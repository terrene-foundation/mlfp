MLFP06 — Assessment Task 1: Schema-Constrained Extraction

Complete the `solve()` function. Read problem.md for the full specification.
Drive a local Ollama LLM with a Kaizen Signature (type-safe structured output)
at temperature 0, and extract one structured record per incident report.

Your submission is auto-graded on schema compliance + field accuracy.
