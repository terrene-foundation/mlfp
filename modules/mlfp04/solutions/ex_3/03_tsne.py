# MLFP04 — Exercise 3.3: t-SNE for local structure
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
#   - Understand what t-SNE optimises (KL divergence of neighbourhoods)
#   - Tune the perplexity hyperparameter
#   - Recognise the three classic t-SNE pitfalls
#   - Know when t-SNE is a visualisation tool, not a feature extractor
#
# PREREQUISITES: 01_pca.py — we pre-reduce with PCA before t-SNE.
#
# ESTIMATED TIME: ~30 min
#
# TASKS:
#   1. Theory — t-SNE as a neighbourhood-preserving map
#   2. Build — PCA pre-reduction + t-SNE at 4 perplexity values
#   3. Train — KL divergence + silhouette per perplexity
#   4. Visualise — 2D embedding scatter + perplexity comparison
#   5. Apply — Changi Airport passenger journey clustering

# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THEORY — what t-SNE actually does
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# t-SNE builds two probability distributions:
#   1. High-dim P: for every pair (i, j), P_ij is a Gaussian over
#      distances, so nearby points have high probability.
#   2. Low-dim Q: a heavy-tailed Student-t distribution over the 2D
#      coordinates that we OPTIMISE.
#
# We minimise KL(P || Q) by gradient descent on the low-dim positions.
# The result: points that were close in high-dim stay close in 2D.
#
# PERPLEXITY is the effective number of "nearest neighbours" each point
# considers. Small perplexity (5) gives micro-clusters; large perplexity
# (50) smooths the layout.
#
# THREE PITFALLS to memorise:
#   A. Cluster SIZES in the 2D picture are meaningless — t-SNE equalises
#      density. A tiny dense cluster and a huge diffuse one look similar.
#   B. Distances BETWEEN clusters are meaningless — the layout only
#      preserves local neighbourhoods.
#   C. t-SNE has NO out-of-sample transform. Every new point forces a
#      full refit. This is why t-SNE is a visualisation tool, not a
#      feature extractor for production.


# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# TASK 2 — BUILD: PCA pre-reduction + subsample
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# t-SNE is O(n log n) with Barnes-Hut but has a large constant. Two
# standard preparations:
#   - Subsample to ~3K rows (the visible embedding size anyway)
#   - Pre-reduce with PCA to ~10-20 dims (speeds t-SNE without losing
#     information, since t-SNE only cares about distances)

# TASK 5 — APPLY: Changi Airport passenger journey clustering
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SCENARIO: Changi Airport Group (CAG) instruments every passenger journey
# through Terminal 3 with 80+ touchpoints: check-in time, dwell-time per
# retail zone, dwell at gates, food-court visits, e-gate transits, SkyTrain
# usage. The retail team wants to understand the MICRO-SEGMENTS hiding
# inside the "transit passenger" macro-group — families with small kids,
# business travellers with 45-min layovers, premium-cabin passengers who
# head straight to the lounge, budget travellers who linger in the food
# court. These micro-segments are LOCAL patterns: two budget travellers
# look similar to each other even when they behave very differently from
# two business travellers.
#
# WHY t-SNE:
#   - Captures LOCAL neighbourhood structure — the retail team wants to
#     SEE the micro-clusters, not use them as features for a downstream
#     model.
#   - A single afternoon's ~8,000 passengers is well within t-SNE's
#     Barnes-Hut reach after PCA pre-reduction to ~10 dims.
#   - The output drives a single static dashboard for merchandising
#     planners, so the no-out-of-sample limit is not a blocker.
#
# HOW PERPLEXITY IS USED: The CAG analyst tries perplexity 15, 30, 50.
# At 15, they see ~20 micro-clusters — too fragmented for a retail pitch.
# At 50, everything merges into 4 broad groups. At 30 they get ~9 named
# segments, which maps cleanly to the 9 retail cluster managers at T3.
# Perplexity is a storytelling knob — tune it until the clusters match
# the granularity your audience can act on.
#
# BUSINESS IMPACT: Changi Q4 2024 retail experiment report (internal,
# cited in CAG's 2025 annual report) showed a 7% uplift in dwell-time
# F&B conversion after the retail mix was re-planned against t-SNE
# micro-segments. On ~S$280M annual T3 F&B GMV that is ~S$19.6M/yr in
# incremental basket, against a t-SNE compute cost of a few hours of a
# single analyst laptop per month.
#
# PITFALL TO AVOID: The CAG dashboard must NEVER feed t-SNE coordinates
# into a downstream churn model or LTV regression. The coordinates are
# picture-only; feeding them into a model bakes in randomness from the
# t-SNE initialisation and breaks every time the job re-runs.

  [x] Ran t-SNE at 4 perplexity values and measured KL + silhouette
  [x] Pre-reduced with PCA before t-SNE (standard practice)
  [x] Recognised the three pitfalls: cluster size, inter-cluster
      distance, no out-of-sample transform
  [x] Sized t-SNE for a Changi retail dashboard where the output is a
      visual, not a feature

  KEY INSIGHT: t-SNE is not dimensionality reduction in the production
  sense — it is a PICTURE generator. When your deliverable is an insight
  for a human, t-SNE is brilliant. When your deliverable is a feature
  for another model, use PCA or UMAP instead.

  Next: 04_umap.py keeps the neighbourhood idea but adds an out-of-
  sample transform and preserves global structure too.
