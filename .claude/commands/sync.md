Sync CO/COC artifacts. Behavior depends on repo type (from `.claude/VERSION`).

**Usage**: `/sync [target]`

- At loom/ (coc-source): `target` = `py`, `rs`, or `all`. If omitted, ask.
- At downstream projects (coc-project): no target needed.

## Step 0: Detect Repo Type

Read `.claude/VERSION` → `type` field:

- `coc-source` → Gate 1 + Gate 2 (below)
- `coc-project` → Downstream Sync (next section)
- `coc-use-template` / `coc-build` → **MUST verify** the repo is the actual template/BUILD repo before routing to loom. Check `basename $(pwd)` + `git remote get-url origin` (normalize SSH `git@host:owner/repo.git` → `owner/repo`) against known repos: `kailash-coc-claude-{py,rs,rb,prism}`, `kailash-{py,rs,prism}`. If match → "receives artifacts from loom/, run `/sync` at loom/". If no match → treat as `coc-project` and auto-correct VERSION in-place (type → `coc-project`, upstream → `{template, template_repo, template_version, synced_at, sdk_packages}` per `.claude/hooks/lib/version-utils.js::correctTemplateDerivedVersion`), then Downstream Sync.
- Missing → ask user what type this repo is

## Downstream Sync (coc-project repos)

Pull latest artifacts from the USE template repo. No target needed — reads template identity from VERSION.

**Process**:

1. **Resolve template** (canonical resolver, v2.9.1+):
   `node "$RESOLVED_TEMPLATE_PATH/.claude/bin/resolve-template.js"` if a previous
   sync already exists locally, OR for first-time sync:
   `node "$(npm root -g 2>/dev/null)/.../bin/resolve-template.js"` is unavailable —
   instead, replicate the resolver inline. Resolution order:
   - **Step 1** — `KAILASH_COC_TEMPLATE_PATH` env var. If set and contains `.claude/`, use it. Source: `env-override`.
   - **Step 2** — Cache at `~/.cache/kailash-coc/<template>/`. Auto-update via `git -C <cache> fetch --depth 1 origin main && git -C <cache> reset --hard origin/main`. Source: `cache`.
   - **Step 3** — If no cache: `git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/<template_repo>.git ~/.cache/kailash-coc/<template>/`. Source: `cloned`.
   - **Step 4 (offline fallback only)** — Local sibling at `../<template>/` or `~/repos/loom/<template>/`. Used ONLY when steps 2-3 all fail (network unreachable). Source: `sibling-offline-fallback`. Emit a `freshness NOT guaranteed` notice.
   - If a local sibling is detected during online resolution but NOT used, emit one stderr notice telling the user to set `KAILASH_COC_TEMPLATE_PATH` if they meant to use it.
   - Known slugs: `kailash-coc-claude-{py,rs,rb,prism}` and the new multi-CLI `kailash-coc-{py,rs}` all live under `terrene-foundation/`.
   - **NEVER use the legacy `scripts/resolve-template.js` shim** — it was added to the manifest's `obsoleted:` list in v2.9.1 and is purged in step 3 below.
2. **Read obsoleted list from the resolved template**: `cat "$RESOLVED_TEMPLATE_PATH/.claude/.coc-obsoleted"` (slim purpose-built file; emitted by coc-sync Step 4.5). Each non-comment, non-blank line is a repo-relative path; trailing slash means directory. If the file is missing, the template predates v2.9.1 — log a one-line warning, skip step 3, and proceed; the obsoleted purge will happen on the NEXT sync once the template upgrades.
3. **Purge obsoleted paths in this consumer (MUST, before any merge)**:
   For each entry in the obsoleted list:
   ```bash
   for path in <obsoleted-paths>; do
     if [ -e "./$path" ]; then
       rm -rf "./$path"
       echo "obsoleted: removed ./$path"
     fi
   done
   ```
   This is the ONLY mechanism by which downstream consumers purge stale orphan directories from former COC layouts. Skipping it leaves `require("./lib/...")` resolving against the wrong sibling and ships hooks that fail at every CC session start with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
4. **Diff** template's `.claude/` against local — MUST diff EVERY child directory under `.claude/`, NOT only the COC-tier directories. Specifically the diff MUST include:
   - `.claude/agents/**`, `.claude/commands/**`, `.claude/rules/**`, `.claude/skills/**`, `.claude/guides/**` (the codegen-content tiers)
   - `.claude/hooks/**` — runtime enforcement scripts (canonical location since v2.9.1; required for SessionStart, PreToolUse, etc. to fire)
   - `.claude/hooks/lib/**` — sibling helper modules (`workspace-utils.js`, etc.) loaded via `require("./lib/...")` from `hooks/*.js`
   - `.claude/bin/**` — resolver + emitter binaries (`resolve-template.js`, `emit.mjs`); without these the resolver cannot run
   - `.claude/.coc-obsoleted` — the obsoleted-purge contract file itself (read in step 2; updates land here)
   - Top-level `scripts/migrate.py` and other items declared in the manifest's `variant_only:` block — these live OUTSIDE `.claude/` but are part of the syncable set
   - **NOT** `scripts/hooks/` or `.claude/scripts/` — those are obsoleted (purged in step 3) and MUST NOT be re-emitted.
   **BLOCKED rationalizations:** "hooks/ are not codegen artifacts so the diff skips them" / "the manifest tiers section doesn't list hooks/**, so hooks aren't in the syncable set" / "the consumer's settings.json hooks paths are normalized in step 7, so the scripts arriving on disk is a separate concern". The `.claude/hooks/` directory MUST physically exist on the consumer's disk for the normalized settings.json paths to resolve at runtime — hook-path normalization without hook-script delivery is a no-op that ships a broken session.
5. **Additive merge** (same semantics as Gate 2 step 4):
   - Template files overwrite matching local files
   - Local-only files preserved (never deleted) **except** paths matching the manifest's `obsoleted:` list (handled in step 3 above)
   - **NEVER overwritten** (downstream-owned): `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/VERSION`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.env`, `.git/`, `.claude/.proposals/`, `.claude/learning/`
   - Other exclusions: see sync-flow guide § "What downstream NEVER gets"
6. **Present merge plan** with per-file decisions before applying — include the obsoleted-path deletions from step 3 in the plan output so the user sees exactly what's being removed.
7. **Normalize settings.json hook paths**: scan the consumer's `.claude/settings.json` for any `hooks[].command` entry containing `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/scripts/hooks/` and rewrite to `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/`. Stale references would still fail with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` after step 3 deleted the directory.
8. **Verify** hook paths in `settings.json` resolve on disk under `.claude/hooks/` AND `grep -F 'scripts/hooks' .claude/settings.json` returns zero matches.
9. **Update `.claude/VERSION` in-place** (never replace the file — only update specific fields): `upstream.template_version` ← template VERSION's `version`, `upstream.template_repo` ← resolved GitHub slug, `upstream.synced_at` ← now, `upstream.sdk_packages` ← from template. MUST preserve `type: coc-project`, `upstream.template` (name), and all other fields.
10. **Update SDK pins** in `pyproject.toml`/`Cargo.toml` from template VERSION's `upstream.sdk_packages`
11. **Install**: `uv sync` (py) or `cargo check` (rs) — **MANDATORY**
12. **Update `.claude/.coc-sync-marker`** with timestamp + list of obsoleted paths purged in step 3 (audit trail for the migration)

## Two Gates (coc-source — loom/ only)

This command has two sequential gates. Gate 1 runs automatically if unreviewed changes exist.

### Gate 1: Review (inbound — BUILD repo → loom/)

Scans the BUILD repo for artifact changes not yet upstreamed to loom/.

**Trigger**: Runs automatically when `/sync` detects unreviewed changes. Also runs if the user explicitly says "review" (e.g., `/sync py review`).

**Process**:

1. Read `sync-manifest.yaml` for tier membership and variant mappings
2. Read BUILD repo path from `sync-manifest.yaml` → `repos.{target}.build`
3. **Read SDK version** from BUILD repo's `pyproject.toml` (py) or `Cargo.toml` (rs). Report it in the review header so the reviewer knows which SDK release these artifacts come from.
4. Compute **expected state**: for each file in loom/.claude/, apply the correct variant overlay for this target. This is what the BUILD repo SHOULD have if it were freshly synced.
5. Diff BUILD repo's `.claude/` against expected state
6. Also check for `.claude/.proposals/latest.yaml` (created by /codify):
   - If `status: pending_review` — new unprocessed proposal. Proceed with review.
   - If `status: reviewed` — already classified in a prior `/sync`, but check whether new changes were appended after the review (look for entries below the `reviewed_date`). If new entries exist, re-review only those.
   - If `status: distributed` — fully processed. Skip proposal review unless BUILD repo diffs show changes outside the proposal.
   - If the proposal includes `sdk_version`, verify it matches the current BUILD repo SDK version — a mismatch means the proposal is stale (codified against an older release).
   - Multi-session proposals may contain changes from several `/codify` sessions (separated by date-stamped comment blocks). Review ALL unreviewed changes, not just the latest session.
7. For each NEW or MODIFIED file, classify:
   - Deploy **sync-reviewer** agent team for autonomous classification (global vs variant vs skip)
   - Agent team reads both source and BUILD versions, checks for language-specific content
   - Present consolidated classification with reasoning for approval

8. For each change classified as **global**, consider cross-SDK impact:
   - Does rs need an equivalent adaptation? If yes → create alignment note.

9. Place files:
   - **Global** → copy to `loom/.claude/{type}/{file}`
   - **Variant** → copy to `loom/.claude/variants/{lang}/{type}/{file}`
   - **Skip** → leave in BUILD repo only

10. Mark proposal as reviewed (update `.proposals/latest.yaml` status)

**Skip conditions**: Gate 1 is skipped when:

- No changes detected between BUILD repo and expected state
- User explicitly says "distribute only" or "skip review"

### Gate 2: Distribute (outbound — loom/ → templates)

Merges loom/ source + variant overlays into USE template repos. This is a **merge** — templates may have legitimate local content.

**Process**:

1. **Read manifest** (`sync-manifest.yaml`) for tiers, variants, exclusions (`exclude:`, `use_exclude:`)
2. **Inventory the template** — read what's currently there before computing changes
3. **Compute expected state** for the target (py or rs):
   - Global codegen-content from `.claude/`: `agents/`, `commands/`, `rules/`, `skills/`, `guides/`
   - **Apply `use_exclude:`** — paths listed there are BUILD-only (cross-SDK parity, sibling-SDK awareness, loom-internal mechanism guides). USE-template emission MUST skip them. Symmetric with `build_exclude:` for `/sync-to-build`. `/sync-to-build` ignores `use_exclude:`.
   - **Global runtime infrastructure from `.claude/` (MUST include — easily missed):**
     - `.claude/hooks/**` (canonical since v2.9.1) — every `*.js` plus the `lib/` sibling helpers
     - `.claude/bin/**` — `resolve-template.js`, `emit.mjs`, and any other resolver/emitter binaries
     - `.claude/.coc-obsoleted` — the obsoleted-purge contract file (regenerated by Step 4.5)
   - Variant overlay from `variants/{lang}/` — replacements and additions, including any `variants/{lang}/hooks/*.js` declared in `variant_only:`
   - Top-level non-`.claude/` files declared in `variant_only:` (e.g. `scripts/migrate.py`)
   - **NOT** `scripts/hooks/` or `.claude/scripts/` — obsoleted in v2.9.1, MUST NOT be re-emitted to any target.

   **BLOCKED rationalizations (Gate 2):** "the manifest tiers section enumerates the artifact set, hooks aren't in it" / "the multi-CLI emitter regenerates hooks via cli_variants, no need to copy" / "the consumer settings.json points at hooks/, that's enough" / "we'll fix the missing hooks on the next sync". Skipping `hooks/` or `bin/` ships a USE template whose downstream consumers have settings.json entries pointing at a non-existent directory; every CC session at the consumer fails SessionStart with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
4. **Per-file merge decisions**:
   - **UNCHANGED** → skip
   - **NEW** (in source, not in template) → add
   - **MODIFIED** (both exist, content differs) → read both versions. If template has USE-specific adaptations (e.g., different wording for downstream context), flag for review before overwriting
   - **TEMPLATE-ONLY** (in template, not in source) → preserve (never delete)
5. **Present merge plan** with per-file decisions, not a bulk "Apply all"
6. **Apply approved changes**
7. **Update `.coc-sync-marker`** with timestamp and file list
8. **Update `.claude/VERSION`** — set `upstream.build_version` to loom/'s version. Create VERSION if missing (per `guides/co-setup/08-versioning.md`). **MUST update `upstream.sdk_packages`** with all package versions from the BUILD repo (read from `pyproject.toml`/`Cargo.toml`). This map is what session-start hooks use to detect stale pins in downstream repos.
9. **Update SDK dependency pins** in the target's `pyproject.toml` (py) or `Cargo.toml` (rs) — **MANDATORY, never skip**:
   - **py**: Read version from BUILD repo's root `pyproject.toml` and each `packages/*/pyproject.toml`. Update the target's `pyproject.toml` `dependencies` section so each Kailash package pin (`>=X.Y.Z`) matches the BUILD repo's current release version. This applies to ALL targets — templates AND downstream repos.
   - **rs**: Read version from BUILD repo's root `Cargo.toml` and workspace member `Cargo.toml` files. Update the target's `Cargo.toml` dependency versions accordingly.
   - Report any version changes in the sync report.
10. **Install updated dependencies** — **MANDATORY, never skip**:
    - **py**: Run `uv sync` in the target repo. If `.venv` doesn't exist, run `uv venv && uv sync`. MUST NOT use `pip install`, `pip install -e .`, or any non-`uv` installer.
    - **rs**: Run `cargo check` in the target repo to verify dependency resolution.
    - Report success/failure in the sync report.
11. **Verify hooks** — every hook in `settings.json` has a corresponding script on disk
12. **Mark proposal as distributed** — after Gate 2 completes successfully, update the BUILD repo's `.claude/.proposals/latest.yaml`:
    - Set `status: distributed`
    - Add `distributed_date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
    - This signals to the next `/codify` run that it is safe to create a fresh proposal (or archive and replace). Without this step, `/codify` would see `reviewed` and append rather than start fresh, accumulating stale entries indefinitely.

**Report**:

```
## Sync Report: loom/ → kailash-coc-claude-py/
Gate 1: 3 reviewed (1 global, 1 variant-py, 1 skipped), SDK 2.2.1
Gate 2: 12 updated, 2 added, 1 flagged, 482 unchanged, 3 preserved
SDK pins: kailash 2.2.1→2.3.0, kailash-dataflow 1.2.1→1.3.0
Dependencies: uv sync ✓ | Hooks: 11/11 | VERSION: 1.0.0→1.1.0
```

## Exclusions

Never synced: `learning/`, `.proposals/`, `sync-manifest.yaml`, `variants/`, `settings.local.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.env`, `.git/`. See sync-flow guide § "What downstream NEVER gets" for full list.

## Delegate

**Gate 1**: Delegate to **sync-reviewer** agent. **Gate 2**: Delegate to **coc-sync** agent — MUST read target content before writing, no bulk overwrites. **Downstream**: No delegation needed — agent handles directly.

## Examples

- `/sync py` — loom/: review kailash-py changes, merge to coc-claude-py
- `/sync` — downstream project: pull latest from USE template
