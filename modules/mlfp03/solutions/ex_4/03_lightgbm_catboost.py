# MLFP03 — Exercise 4.3: LightGBM and CatBoost — Same Task, Faster Trees
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
#   - Train LightGBM and CatBoost on the same Singapore credit data
#   - Explain LightGBM's histogram-based split finding (why it's fast on
#     large data) and GOSS (gradient-based one-side sampling)
#   - Explain CatBoost's ordered boosting (why it's robust to target
#     leakage on categorical features)
#   - Compare the three libraries on AUC-PR, log loss, and train time
#   - Decide which library to use based on data shape and constraints
#
# PREREQUISITES: Exercise 4.2 (XGBoost baseline on the same dataset).
#
# ESTIMATED TIME: ~35 min
#
# TASKS:
#   1. Theory — how LightGBM and CatBoost differ from XGBoost
#   2. Build — LightGBM + CatBoost with matched hyperparameters
#   3. Train — fit both, record train time and AUC-PR
#   4. Visualise — side-by-side bar chart with XGBoost as baseline
#   5. Apply — Singapore supermarket chain picks a library for fraud

# THEORY — Three Libraries, One Gradient-Boosting Recipe
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# All three libraries build additive trees on pseudo-residuals — the
# theory from 4.1 applies identically. They differ in HOW they find the
# best split at each round:
#
# XGBoost: exact split finding. Sorts every feature, evaluates every
#   possible split threshold. Accurate but O(n·d·log n) per round.
#
# LightGBM: histogram-based split finding. Buckets each feature into
#   ~256 bins, evaluates splits between bins only. O(n·d) per round —
#   ~5-10x faster on large data. Adds two more tricks:
#     - GOSS (gradient-based one-side sampling): keep all rows with
#       large gradients (hard examples), randomly sample the easy ones.
#     - EFB (exclusive feature bundling): bundle sparse features that
#       never overlap into a single "super-feature" — further speedup
#       on wide sparse data.
#   LightGBM also grows trees leaf-wise (best-first) instead of
#   level-wise, which usually gives lower loss for the same leaf count
#   but can overfit if max_depth is unset.
#
# CatBoost: ordered boosting. The problem CatBoost solves is target
#   leakage on categorical features — "mean-target encoding" (replace
#   each category with its average target) leaks the target into the
#   training set, inflating training accuracy. CatBoost fixes this by
#   computing target statistics only from rows that come BEFORE the
#   current row in a random permutation, then re-permuting each round.
#   Result: best out-of-the-box performance on data with many high-
#   cardinality categoricals, and the least tuning effort of the three.
#
# Practical decision tree:
#   ≫ >1M rows, mostly numeric        → LightGBM (speed wins)
#   ≫ High-cardinality categoricals   → CatBoost (no manual encoding)
#   ≫ Medium data, mixed types        → XGBoost (stable default)
#
# We train all three with matched hyperparameters so the comparison is
# about the LIBRARY, not the hyperparameters.

# TASK 5 — APPLY: FairPrice Fraud Detection Library Choice
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SCENARIO: NTUC FairPrice (Singapore's largest grocery retailer) runs a
# real-time fraud-detection model on card-present transactions across
# ~160 stores. The model scores every swipe in <50ms and flags suspects
# for a manager callback before the receipt prints.
#
# Data shape:
#   - Rows: ~4M transactions per day
#   - Features: 60% numeric (amount, velocity, time-of-day), 40%
#     categorical (store, SKU bundles, payment network, card BIN)
#   - Cardinality: store has 160 levels; SKU bundle has ~12,000 levels;
#     card BIN has ~9,000 levels
#   - Class balance: 0.2% fraud rate (severely imbalanced)
#   - Re-train cadence: nightly, on the last 30 days = ~120M rows
#
# LIBRARY CHOICE: CatBoost
#   - High-cardinality categoricals (SKU bundle, card BIN) would require
#     ordinal encoding for XGBoost/LightGBM, leaking ordering info into
#     features that have no natural order.
#   - CatBoost's ordered boosting handles them without manual encoding
#     and without target leakage.
#   - The 3-5x train-time penalty vs LightGBM is acceptable: 120M rows
#     trains overnight on a 16-core box (~4 hours), well inside the
#     nightly window.
#
# WHY NOT LIGHTGBM: LightGBM on 160 store levels and 12K SKU bundles
# requires target encoding — this is the exact failure mode CatBoost was
# built for. You can make it work with careful cross-validated target
# encoding, but you own that pipeline and its bugs forever.
#
# WHY NOT XGBOOST: Same high-cardinality encoding problem, plus XGBoost
# is ~5x slower than LightGBM on 120M rows so it would blow through the
# nightly window.
#
# BUSINESS IMPACT: FairPrice processes ~S$4.5B in card transactions per
# year. Industry benchmarks put card-present fraud at 3-6 basis points
# of sales = S$1.3-2.7M in annual losses. A model with AUC-PR 0.65
# (typical for well-tuned CatBoost on this data shape) recovers ~40% of
# fraud = ~S$800K-1.1M per year in avoided losses, against a ~S$80K/year
# total infrastructure cost for training + scoring. 10-14x ROI before
# accounting for the 0.15% lift in legitimate-transaction approval rates
# from fewer false positives — which is usually the larger business win.
