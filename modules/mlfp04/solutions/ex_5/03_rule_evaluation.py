# MLFP04 — Exercise 5.3: Rule Evaluation — Support, Confidence, Lift, Conviction
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
#   - Turn frequent itemsets into directional association rules (X -> Y)
#   - Compute the four standard rule-quality metrics
#   - Apply a three-threshold filter (support + confidence + lift)
#   - Separate cross-category rules from within-category rules
#   - Rank actionable rules for business stakeholders
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#   - 01_apriori_from_scratch.py (frequent itemset mining)
#   - Basic probability (conditional probability, independence)
#
# ESTIMATED TIME: ~40 min
#
# TASKS:
#   1. Theory — what each rule metric means mathematically and in business terms
#   2. Build — implement `generate_rules()` and the three-threshold filter
#   3. Train — mine + score rules on the Singapore retail basket
#   4. Visualise — top rules table + support/confidence/lift scatter

# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THEORY — The Four Rule Quality Metrics
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# A rule "X -> Y" says: baskets containing X tend to also contain Y.
# It is a statistical summary, not a causal claim. We score it with four
# metrics because each one catches a different failure mode.
#
#   SUPPORT     supp(X u Y) = count(X u Y) / N
#               How often the pair appears. Low support = not enough data
#               to trust the rule; rules with support < 1% are noise on
#               most retail datasets.
#
#   CONFIDENCE  conf(X -> Y) = supp(X u Y) / supp(X)
#               P(Y given X). How RELIABLE the rule is when X is present.
#               A 95% confidence rule fires ~19 out of 20 times X appears.
#
#   LIFT        lift(X -> Y) = conf(X -> Y) / supp(Y)
#               = P(Y|X) / P(Y). How SURPRISING the rule is. Lift = 1
#               means X and Y are independent. Lift > 1 is positive
#               association — X raises the probability of Y. Lift < 1 is
#               negative association (substitutes, not complements).
#
#   CONVICTION  conv(X -> Y) = (1 - supp(Y)) / (1 - conf(X -> Y))
#               Directional strength. Unlike lift (symmetric), conviction
#               asymmetrically measures how much X IMPLIES Y. Conviction
#               of 1 = independence; conviction of infinity = perfect
#               implication (conf = 1, never violated).
#
# THE THREE-THRESHOLD FILTER (the only one that matters in practice)
#
#   keep the rule if:
#     support >= s_min        (enough baskets -> statistical power)
#     confidence >= c_min     (reliable enough to act on)
#     lift > 1                (surprising enough to be informative)
#
# Any ONE of these alone is a trap: high-confidence low-lift rules are
# just popularity (everyone buys milk, so any X -> milk has high
# confidence but zero insight). Low-support high-lift rules are often
# just statistical artefacts.

# INTERPRETATION: Cross-category rules are the commercially interesting
# ones. Within-category rules (shampoo + soap) mostly restate what a
# store manager already knows — they both sit in the personal-care
# aisle. Cross-category rules (breakfast items -> beverages) are where
# Association Rules pay for themselves: they surface adjacencies you
# did not explicitly plan for.


# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# TASK 5 — APPLY: Watsons personalisation engine
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SCENARIO: Watsons operates ~110 stores across Singapore plus an online
# channel. The CRM team wants a "buy-together" recommender that shows
# a shopper exactly ONE extra product on the cart page, chosen to
# maximise incremental basket value. The recommendation MUST be:
#   - Reliable  (high confidence — doesn't annoy shoppers with misses)
#   - Surprising (high lift — not just "you bought shampoo, try soap")
#   - Popular   (high support — enough stock to fulfil)
#
# The three-threshold filter above is literally the product spec for
# this recommender: support gates inventory, confidence gates annoyance,
# lift gates relevance.
#
# BUSINESS IMPACT: Industry A/B tests on cart-page recommenders typically
# show 2-4% conversion lift and 5-9% AOV lift when the recommendation is
# driven by high-lift association rules rather than "most popular."
# Watsons SG's reported online GMV is on the order of S$200M/year; a
# 6% AOV lift on the recommended items alone is ~S$3-6M/year in pure
# margin — on top of brand uplift from "the app knows what I need."
#
# LIMITATIONS:
#   - Association rules are backward-looking; seasonal or new-launch items
#     need a cold-start fallback (Ex 7 matrix factorisation helps here)
#   - A rule is a correlation, not a preference — always pair with
#     business rules (don't recommend a more expensive substitute to a
#     shopper who just demonstrated price sensitivity)
