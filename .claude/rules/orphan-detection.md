# Orphan Detection Rules

A class that no production code calls is a lie. Beautifully implemented orphans accumulate when a feature is built top-down — model + facade + accessor get checked in, the public API documents them, downstream consumers import them — but the wiring from the product's hot path to the new class never lands. The orphan keeps passing unit tests against itself, the product keeps shipping, and the security/audit/governance promise the orphan was supposed to deliver never executes once.

This is the failure mode kailash-py Phase 5.11 surfaced: 2,407 LOC of trust integration code (`TrustAwareQueryExecutor`, `DataFlowAuditStore`, `TenantTrustManager`) was instantiated and exposed as `db.trust_executor` / `db.audit_store` / `db.trust_manager`, four downstream workspaces imported the classes, and zero production code paths invoked any method on them. Operators believed the trust plane was running for an unknown period; it was not.

The rule below prevents this by requiring every facade-shaped class on a public API to have a verifiable consumer in the production hot path within a bounded number of commits.

## MUST Rules

### 1. Every `db.*` / `app.*` Facade Has a Production Call Site

Any attribute exposed on a public surface that returns a `*Manager`, `*Executor`, `*Store`, `*Registry`, `*Engine`, or `*Service` MUST have at least one call site inside the framework's production hot path within 5 commits of the facade landing. The call site MUST live in the same package as the framework, not just in tests or downstream consumers.

```python
# DO — facade + production call site land in the same PR
class DataFlow:
    @property
    def trust_executor(self) -> TrustAwareQueryExecutor:
        return self._trust_executor

# # In the framework's hot path (e.g., express.py)
class DataFlowExpress:
    async def list(self, model, ...):
        plan = await self._db.trust_executor.check_read_access(...)  # ← real call site
        ...

# DO NOT — facade ships, no call site, downstream consumers import the orphan
class DataFlow:
    @property
    def trust_executor(self) -> TrustAwareQueryExecutor:
        return self._trust_executor
# (no call site exists in any framework hot path; trust executor is dead code)
```

**Why:** Downstream consumers see the public attribute, build their security model around the class's documented behavior, and ship features that silently bypass the protection because the framework never invokes the class on the actual data path.

### 2. Every Wired Manager Has a Tier 2 Integration Test

Once a manager is wired into the production hot path, its end-to-end behavior MUST be exercised by at least one Tier 2 integration test (real database, real adapter — `rules/testing.md` § Tier 2). Unit tests against the manager class in isolation are NOT sufficient.

```python
# DO — Tier 2 test exercises the wired path against real infrastructure
@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_trust_executor_redacts_in_express_read(test_suite):
    db = DataFlow(test_suite.config.url)
    @db.model
    class Document:
        title: str
        body: str
    set_clearance(PUBLIC)
    rows = await db.express.list("Document")
    assert all(row["body"] == "[REDACTED]" for row in rows)

# DO NOT — Tier 1 test against the class in isolation
def test_trust_executor_returns_redacted_plan():
    executor = TrustAwareQueryExecutor(...)
    plan = executor.check_read_access(...)
    assert plan.redact_columns == {"body"}
# ↑ proves the executor can redact, NOT that the framework calls it
```

**Why:** Unit tests prove the orphan implements its API. Integration tests prove the framework actually calls the orphan.

### 3. Removed = Deleted, Not Deprecated

If a manager is found to be an orphan and the team decides not to wire it, it MUST be deleted from the public surface in the same PR — not marked deprecated, not left behind a feature flag, not commented out. Orphans-with-warnings still mislead downstream consumers about the framework's contract.

**Why:** Deprecation banners are easy to miss; consumers continue importing the symbol and silently shipping insecure code. Deletion is the only signal that survives a `pip install kailash --upgrade`.

## MUST NOT

- Land a `db.X` / `app.X` facade without the production call site in the same PR

**Why:** The PR review is the only structural gate that catches orphans before they ship; allowing the gate to bypass means the orphan is in production by the next release.

- Skip the consumer check on the grounds that "downstream consumers will use it"

**Why:** Downstream consumers using a class is not the same as the framework using it. The framework's hot path is the security boundary; downstream consumers are clients of that boundary, not enforcers of it.

- Mark a wired manager as "fully tested" based on Tier 1 unit tests alone

**Why:** Tier 1 mocks the framework's call into the manager. The orphan failure mode is precisely "the framework never calls the manager in production" — Tier 1 cannot detect that.

## Detection Protocol

When auditing for orphans, run this protocol against every class exposed on the public surface:

1. **Surface scan** — list every property, method, and attribute on the framework's top-level class that returns a `*Manager` / `*Executor` / `*Store` / `*Registry` / `*Engine` / `*Service`.
2. **Hot-path grep** — for each candidate, grep the framework's source (NOT tests, NOT downstream consumers) for calls into the class's methods. Zero matches in the hot path = orphan.
3. **Tier 2 grep** — for each non-orphan, grep `tests/integration/` and `tests/e2e/` for the class name. Zero matches = unverified wiring.
4. **Disposition** — every orphan and every unverified wiring MUST be either fixed (wire + test) or deleted (remove from public surface).

This protocol runs as part of `/redteam` and `/codify`.
